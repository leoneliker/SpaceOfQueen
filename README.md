# SpaceOfQueen
My first videogame developed
It was doing at the start follow a bit instruction of my teacher, but then I decided to expand the game.


## What is the game about
It is a sketch developed on processing, using java and a library called minim.
This game is a version of the mythical space invaders but the sounds are based on the rock group Queen.

If you play this game, or just observe the code, you can see that it is really simple and it has a lot of style failures, I didn't use POO.
But I wanted to upload it because it was the first game created 4 years ago and I already have plans to remake it.
